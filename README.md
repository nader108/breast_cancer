# ðŸ”¬ Breast Cancer Detection System using YOLOv8m

This project is a web-based breast cancer detection system that leverages the power of the YOLOv8m model from Ultralytics. It allows users to upload medical images (e.g., mammograms) and get predictions about potential cancerous regions directly in the browser.
